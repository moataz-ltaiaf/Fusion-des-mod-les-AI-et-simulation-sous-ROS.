## research on Depth Camera
Introduction to Depth Cameras
Definition and Technology: Depth cameras combine traditional RGB (color) imaging with depth sensing, providing 3D information about the scene.
Types of Depth Sensing Technologies:
Stereo Vision: Uses two cameras to triangulate the depth of objects.
Time-of-Flight (ToF): Measures the time light takes to bounce back from objects.
Structured Light: Projects a pattern of light onto the scene and analyzes the deformation to calculate dept
### Advancements in Depth Camera Technology
Improved Depth Sensing Algorithms: New methods for enhancing depth accuracy, such as machine learning-based approaches.
Higher Resolution and Frame Rates: Development of cameras with better resolution and faster processing speeds.
Miniaturization and Integration: Smaller, more integrated sensors suitable for mobile devices and wearables.
AI and Depth Cameras: Use of artificial intelligence to interpret and utilize depth data more effectively, such as in object detection and scene understanding
