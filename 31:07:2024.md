## research on 2D LiDAR technology
A 2D LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a technology that measures distances by emitting laser beams and calculating the time it takes for the light to bounce off an object and return to the sensor. Unlike 3D LiDAR, which creates three-dimensional images, 2D LiDAR captures a single line or plane of data, making it ideal for specific applications where a cross-sectional view is sufficient.
### Applications of 2D LiDAR
Mobile Robots and Autonomous Navigation:

2D LiDAR is widely used in robotics for navigation, mapping, and obstacle avoidance. Mobile robots utilize 2D LiDAR to create maps of their environment by detecting obstacles around them.
Security and Surveillance Systems:

2D LiDAR can be employed in security systems to detect the presence of objects or people within a specific area. This allows for the triggering of alarms or other security measures.
Industrial Automation:

In industrial settings, 2D LiDAR is used for controlling automated processes, such as guiding automated guided vehicles (AGVs) or ensuring precise positioning of objects on production lines.
