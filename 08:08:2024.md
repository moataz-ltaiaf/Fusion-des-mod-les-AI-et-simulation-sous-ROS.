### Daily Meeting - Error Corrections in YOLOv8

**Progress Made:**
Since our last daily, I've been working on integrating YOLOv8 into our project, particularly focusing on displaying detected objects in RViz. However, during testing, several issues and performance problems were identified.

**Errors Identified:**
1. **False Positives/Negatives:** YOLOv8 was generating false positives and negatives under certain lighting conditions or object positioning.
2. **Data Synchronization:** There were synchronization issues between YOLOv8 detections and their display in RViz, leading to delays in real-time visualization.
3. **Performance Degradation:** Displaying a large number of detected objects simultaneously caused slowdowns in RViz, impacting the user experience.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Adjusting Confidence Thresholds:** Revise the confidence thresholds in YOLOv8 to reduce false positives and improve overall detection accuracy.
2. **Optimizing Synchronization:** Implement a more robust synchronization mechanism to ensure that the data displayed in RViz aligns with the actual detections.
3. **Enhancing Performance:** Explore solutions to reduce the load on RViz, such as lowering the display frequency or simplifying the representation of detected objects.

**Challenges to Anticipate:**
- **Balancing Accuracy and Performance:** Finding the right balance between detection accuracy and smooth visualization in RViz.
- **Extensive Testing:** The need to test these adjustments in various scenarios to ensure they work well in all project conditions.
